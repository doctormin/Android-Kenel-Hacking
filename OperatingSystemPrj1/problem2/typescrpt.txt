process number = 73
entries number = 73
------------------p.s.-----------------------
entries number is the number of copied entries
process number is the number of all processes (may be bigger than process number)
------------exception handlering-------------
1. failed in calling `copy_to_user`
(in kernel log) << failed in function copy_to_user(buf_in_kernel -> buf)
(in kernel log) << failed in function copy_to_user(nr_in_kernel -> nr)

2. failed when printing the process tree (can not find the parent of a process) (this should never happen actually.)
(in terminal) << buf[i].pid buf[i].comm find parent failed!
